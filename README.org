** Consistency models

Consistency is the main problem when dealing with replicas. A /consistency model/ is a contract that provides a set of guarantees to processes that access a distributed data store.

In a /strict consistency/ model, any read operation returns the value of the last write. In other words, any write is instantaneously visible to all the processes. This is an ideal but impossible model since
- Distributed systems have no global clock.
- Conflicts can arise even in a local system.

The /sequential consistency/ model guarantees that all processes see the same interleaving of operations in some sequential order.
