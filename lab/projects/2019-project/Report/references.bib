The sensornetworks can be used for various applicationareas (e.g., health, military, home). For differentapplication areas, there are different technicalissues that researchers are currently resolving.The current state of the art of sensor networks iscaptured in this article, where solutions are discussedunder their related protocol stack layersections. This article also points out the openresearch issues and intends to spark new interestsand developments in this field.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensors and wireless sensor networks
have come to the forefront of the scientific community
recently. This is the consequence of engineering increasingly
smaller sized devices, which enable many applications. The
use of these sensors and the possibility of organizing them into
networks have revealed many research issues and have
highlighted new ways to cope with certain problems. In this
paper, different applications areas where the use of such
sensor networks has been proposed are surveyed.},
